# Calorie Tracker

Calorie Tracker is a web application to track daily calories, fat, and fiber, and tells you how many weight watcher points each food item is. This project uses the original weight watchers point system:

(calories / 50) + (fat / 12) - (fiber / 12) = original WW points

## Instalation

## Usage

The Calorie Tracker has a field to add a new day by Typing in the day and clicking add.
The new day is added to your list of days.
When you click on a day you can add food items.
When a food item is added it displays it under that day and calculates the WW points.
You are able to edit and delete food items
Currently, days cannot be edited or deleted and must be entered correctly.
